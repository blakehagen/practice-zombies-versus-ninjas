Zombies versus Ninjas
=====================

A mini project to practice modeling with Mongoose.

## Objectives

Create a simple MongoDB database using mongoose that models a simple zombies versus ninja game.

##Step 1: Setup a node.js project

1. Create a node project.
2. Npm install mongoose

##Step 2: Model the following

1. Create a ninja model that has allows a ninja to store its health, weapons, skills, abilities and the zombies that has been killed by the ninja
2. Create a zombie model that allows a zombie to store its health, appendages (arms, legs, etc), attackLevel, number of consumed ninjas. 
3. Make sure to display the ninajs and zombies as whole objects instead of the relationships (number of zombies killed, and number of ninjas consumed

##Step 3: Create an express api that exposes the zombies and the ninajs
